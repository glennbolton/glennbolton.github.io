The latest update to [DD-AWS](https://github.com/DefendableDesign/DD-AWS/releases) now includes automatic remediation for leaky S3 buckets üéâ.

1. A custom [AWS Config Rule](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) checks S3 buckets for dangerous permissions in real time (almost) whenever a change occurs.
1. When a bucket is detected as non-compliant, the Config Rule status changes, and a remediation task is pushed to an [SQS queue](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/).
1. The `Remediation_Coordinator` [Lambda function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) periodically (every 1m) pulls tasks from the Remediation queue and fires off the correct function to fix the problem, in this case the `S3_PublicAccess_Remediation` function.
1. The `S3_PublicAccess_Remediation` function will _selectively_ remove the dangerous part of the Access Control Policy, or Bucket Policy and then call the AWS API to `PutBucketPolicy` or `PutBucketAcl` to remediate the risk.
1. If you've enabled Slack integration, the `Notifier` function lets you know everything that's happening, at every step of the way:
