My name's Glenn, and I write code to solve infosec problems.

I'm an [AWS certified developer](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/) (despite not being a developer), an expert with [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) and I ❤︎ identity and access management and single sign-on (SAML mostly, using [ADFS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/active-directory-federation-services), [mod\_auth\_mellon](https://github.com/UNINETT/mod_auth_mellon) and [SimpleSAMLphp](https://simplesamlphp.org/)).

I'm pretty good with PHP - _which means that I know enough about it to avoid it_.

I'm equally excited and frustrated by [Elastic Stack (_nee ELK_)](https://www.elastic.co/products).

I love C# and think that [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/) is kinda neat. 

At the moment, I'm enjoying working with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to solve security problems at scale.

You can reach me on email at [glenn@defendable.design](mailto:glenn@defendable.design) or [@DefendableSec](https://twitter.com/DefendableSec) on Twitter.
